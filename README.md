# RISC-V-Pipelined-Processor-with-CSR

A 3-stage Pipelined Processor written from scratch in SystemVerilog for executing the machine code of RISC-V ISA with interrupt CSR (Control and Status Register). RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture based on established reduced instruction set computer principles.
